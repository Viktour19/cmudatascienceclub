I'm a data engineer - all things ranging from ETL to ML techniques, configuring infrastructure, and building web services.

I've worked as a software engineer for the past five years. Some interesting projects I've worked on include building and deploying a highly available multicluster web service to analyze huge streams of data - as illustrated here - https://github.com/Viktour19/portfolio/blob/master/multiclusterproject.jpg

Another project involved building a massively scalable web service to analyze ITB of twitter data with high constraints on latency and throughput.

I also have vast experience in building mobile applications, with a number of apps successfully on the app store - https://goo.gl/ko7RE0 

I'm particularly interested in the inter-relationship between data science and the energy domain, and I hope to develop a career along that path.
